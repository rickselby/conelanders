                <h3>Dirt Rally</h3>
                <p>
                    Dirt Rally results are pulled in automatically from the <a href="https://www.dirtgame.com">dirtgame.com</a>
                    website. This runs on a 3-hour schedule, and does an extra pull of results a few minutes before an event
                    is due to close - in case the results completely dissappear when the event ends (which they do on the
                    league webpage, but we can sometimes get them for a short while afterwards.

                    The points system was created by <strong>Georgin</strong>, which I have brought across.

                    The only manual steps are to add new championships, seasons, and events.

                <h3>Assetto Corsa</h3>
                <p>
                    Assetto Corsa results are generated by uploading the <em>json</em> results file from the server.
                    <strong>Th3HolyMoose</strong> wrote a script to parse the file and get the results, which then
                    feeds into the website for displaying.

                <p>
                    The colours for the driver numbers should be representative of the car colours used in-game, but
                    if the in-game colours don't make for a legible number, they are tweaked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gray background on the lap charts denotes when a driver has been lapped. However, the server
                    lets everyone finish the whole race (not just the lap they're on once the leader finishes), so
                    they look a little weird at the end.
